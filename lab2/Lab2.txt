Exercise 2
Have a look at the le wineglass.txt in the resource folder. It has the
same le format as discussed in the slides of this lab.
a) How many faces does this 3D model have? And how many normal
vectors?

700 faces
680 normal vectors

The aim of this exercise is to render ( = visualize) this 3D model.
b) Study the implementation of the Face class in the mesh package. Make
sure that you understand the aim of each instance variable and method
of this class.



c) Make sure that you understand how the Mesh and Face class work to-
gether to represent a 3D object.

d) Implement the readFile method of the Mesh class which reads the 3D
model data from the given le. One may assume that this le has
the format as explained in the slides of this lab. This method should
store the data in the appropriate data structures. Make use of the
java.util.Scanner class to help you reading in the le data.



e) Have a look at the draw method of the Mesh class. It has a loop over all
faces. For each face it tells OpenGL about the coordinates of the normal
vectors and points corresponding to its vertices (with the glNormal3f
and glVertex3f OpenGL method calls). Note however that the coor-
dinates of the normal vectors and vertices are not properly initialized.
Can you x this?
f) Look at the display method of the App1 class in the app1 package.
This method is responsible for drawing the virtual scene. You do not
have to understand the whole implementation. Just note that the draw
method of a Mesh object is called. This Mesh object, however, is not
properly initialized. Can you x this so that this application will render
the wineglass?
g) Run App1 to check your solutions to the previous questions.
